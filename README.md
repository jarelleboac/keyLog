# keyLog
Keylog is a program with which we monitor keystrokes. These keystrokes are stored in a log.txt file. We can record sensitive information like username, password or even credit card information using this keystroke. Other applications: a jealous/suspicious significant other checking their partner's messaging activity on the internet 🤯 , parent control 🤠. 

This is my first cyber security project and I had fun learning more about this quick project on my own. Attached below are some of the keystrokes I logged, stored in a txt file. 👁 👅 👁
